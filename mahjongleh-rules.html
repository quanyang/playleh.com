                        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                        <h4>Winning objective</h4>
                        <p>
                            To win (Hu, 胡), a player needs to form a complete hand consisting of four sets (melds) and one pair (also called the Eye). A set can be either:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Triplet (Pong, 碰):</strong> Three identical tiles (e.g., three 5 Circles)</li>
                            <li><strong>Sequence (Chi, 吃):</strong> Three consecutive tiles of the same suit (e.g., 3, 4, 5 of Bamboo)</li>
                            <li><strong>Quadruplet (Gang/Kong, 槓):</strong> Four identical tiles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            A pair consists of two identical tiles. Once you have four sets and one pair, you can declare a win (Hu), provided the minimum Tai requirement has been met. More information on Scoring can be found below.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Game Setup</h4>
                        <p>The game is played with 4 players, and the players are seated randomly, with the player seated in the east starting as the dealer. The dealer position rotates to the next player in counterclockwise order, except when the dealer wins, or when the game ends in a stalemate and no Gangs were formed during the game.</p>

                        <h5>Prevailing Wind & Seat Wind</h5>
                        <p>
                            Each round has a <strong>Prevailing Wind</strong>, and each player is assigned a <strong>Seat Wind</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Seat Wind:</strong> Determined by the player's position at the table (East, South, West, North).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Prevailing Wind:</strong> Represents the current round wind. The prevailing wind rotates in the order East -> South -> West -> North after each player has served as the dealer.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Game Flow</h4>
                        <p>
                            Each player starts with 13 tiles, and the dealer (East) starts with 14 tiles. Players take turns in counterclockwise order:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Draw one tile from the wall</li>
                            <li><strong>Melding using tiles in hand (Optional):</strong> After drawing a tile, a player may form a quadruplet meld using tiles in their hand</li>
                            <li><strong>Discard:</strong> Discard one tile face-up</li>
                            <li><strong>Melding by claiming the discard (Optional):</strong> Other players may claim the discarded tile to form a meld</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Melding Actions</h4>
                        <p>
                            During gameplay, players can form melds either using the tiles in their hand, or by claiming a discarded tile:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li><strong>Triplet (Pong, 碰):</strong> Claim a discarded tile from any player to form a triplet. You must reveal the triplet and discard a tile.</li>

                                <li>Exposed Gang (明槓): You claim a discarded tile to form a quadruplet with three identical tiles already in your hand.</li>
                                <li>Exposed Gang (明槓): You add a fourth tile from your hand to an already exposed Pong meld.</li>
                            </ul>
                            When forming a Gang, you must draw a replacement tile from the dead wall and discard a tile.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Bonus Tiles</h4>

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Bonus tiles do not count toward your hand structure but may provide bonus Tai (台) when calculating your total Tai.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Winning (Hu, 胡)</h4>
                    <p>

                        <p>

                            Example scenario:<br/>
                            If player A discards a tile that is claimed by player B to win with an 'All Pong' hand, the hand is considered to be 2 Tai (assuming no other bonuses). According to the payout calculation, player C and D will each pay 20 credits to player B, and being the player who discarded the winning tile, player A will pay 40 credits. In total, player B will receive 80 credits.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Instant Payout</h4>
                        <p>
                            Certain actions trigger immediate credit exchanges before the hand ends. Instant payouts are settled immediately and are not affected by the final outcome of the hand. Instant payouts are disabled once the last drawable tile has been drawn.

                        <h4>Shooter Rule</h4>
                        <p>
                            When enabled, the Shooter rule applies additional penalties to the <strong>Shooter</strong> who discards a tile that leads to an instant payout or a win. The shooter is responsible for paying on behalf of everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The shooter rule only applies in the following scenarios:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When a player wins by claiming a discarded tile, the player who discarded the winning tile is known as the <strong>Shooter</strong>. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When a player forms an Exposed Gang meld by claiming a discarded tile, the player who discarded the tile is known as the <strong>Shooter</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When a player wins by Robbing the Gang, the player who formed the Gang is known as the <strong>Shooter</strong>.

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
                        <h4>Dead Wall</h4>
                        <p>
                            The dead wall is a reserve of 15 tiles used for: Bonus tile draws, Gang replacement draws. Tiles in the dead wall are not part of the drawable wall.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Game End Conditions</h4>
                        <p>
                            A game ends when:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A player wins</li>
                            <li>The game ends in a stalemate when there are no more drawable tiles remaining in the live wall (excluding the 15 tiles in the dead wall). When a player draws the last drawable tile, they need not discard any tile (you might be asked to select one, but it is not actually discarded). After drawing the last tile, the player will not be allowed to draw anymore replacement tiles for bonus tiles or Gang, and will not get any instant payouts as well. The player is allowed to win using the last drawn tile.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If the game ends without a winner, it is considered a stalemate, and no points are exchanged.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Special discard Rules</h3>
                        <h4>Sacred & Missed Discard Rules</h4>
                        <p>
                            MahjongLeh enforces the <strong>Sacred Discard (回头牌)</strong> and <strong>Missed Discard (过水牌)</strong> rule to prevent players from claiming tiles they have previously declined.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sacred Discard:</strong> If a player discards a tile, they may not later claim the same tile from another player's discard.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Missed Discard:</strong> If a player passes on a discarded tile and did not claim it, they may not later claim the same tile from another player's discard.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The restriction is lifted only after the player has drawn a tile during their own turn.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Swap Calling (换吃) Rule</h4>
                        <p>
                            MahjongLeh enforces the <strong>Swap Calling (换吃)</strong> rule.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When a player Chows (吃) a discarded tile to form a sequence, they are <strong>not allowed</strong> to immediately discard:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The same tile that was used to Chow, or</li>
                                    <li>A tile on the opposite end of the same sequence</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Example: If a player Chows a <strong>4</strong> to form <strong>4-5-6</strong>, they may not discard a <strong>4</strong> or <strong>6</strong> in that turn.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This rule prevents players from effectively swapping tiles through repeated Chow actions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The restriction applies only to the discard made immediately after the Chow.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
